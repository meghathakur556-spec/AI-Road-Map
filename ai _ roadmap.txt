AI ENGINEERING ROADMAP
=====================

Name: Aradhya
Goal: Become an AI Engineer (Learning by Doing)

---------------------------------------------
PHASE 0: AI & LLM FUNDAMENTALS
---------------------------------------------
Objective:
Understand what AI is and how Large Language Models (LLMs) work at a high level.

Topics:
- What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- AI vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning
- What are Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Examples of LLMs: GPT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA
- Where LLMs are used in real-world products

Outcome:
- Can clearly explain what an LLM is
- Understand the role of AI engineers

---------------------------------------------
PHASE 1: PROMPT ENGINEERING (CORE FOCUS)
---------------------------------------------
Objective:
Learn how to communicate effectively with LLMs to control outputs.

Topics:
- What is a prompt
- System prompt vs User prompt
- Zero-shot prompting
- Few-shot prompting
- Role-based prompting
- Chain-of-thought prompting
- Output formatting (tables, JSON, bullet points)

Practice:
- Ask LLMs to act as a teacher, mentor, developer
- Improve answers by refining prompts
- Convert vague prompts into precise prompts

Outcome:
- Can design effective prompts
- Can guide LLM responses intentionally

---------------------------------------------
PHASE 2: LLM BEHAVIOR & LIMITATIONS
---------------------------------------------
Objective:
Understand how LLMs generate responses and where they fail.

Topics:
- Tokens and tokenization
- Context window
- Temperature and randomness
- Hallucinations
- Bias and limitations of LLMs

Outcome:
- Understand why LLM outputs vary
- Know when not to trust AI responses blindly

---------------------------------------------
PHASE 3: USING LLMs VIA APIs
---------------------------------------------
Objective:
Learn how applications communicate with LLMs programmatically.

Topics:
- What is an API
- How prompts become API requests
- OpenAI API basics
- API keys and security basics
- Simple chatbot workflow

Outcome:
- Can build basic AI-powered applications

---------------------------------------------
PHASE 4: AI ENGINEERING TOOLS & WORKFLOWS
---------------------------------------------
Objective:
Move from simple prompts to real AI systems.

Topics:
- Python fundamentals for AI
- Prompt templates
- LangChain / LlamaIndex (intro)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Connecting AI with documents and data

Outcome:
- Can design practical AI solutions
- Ready for advanced AI engineering concepts

---------------------------------------------
CURRENT FOCUS
---------------------------------------------
- Learning Prompt Engineering
- Understanding LLM fundamentals
- Building a static web app to showcase this roadmap

---------------------------------------------
LEARNING APPROACH
---------------------------------------------
- Learn by building
- Use AI as a coding and learning assistant
- Improve through iteration and feedback
- Focus on practical understanding over theory
